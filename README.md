# Acceron-Assignment
Get order details of customers on the basis of the product they ordered and plot the value of the orders against the customers.

Given that we can't display dynamic plots on github. The plots generated by plotly are stored in the index.html file in the same repository. To view them copy the link of the index file, which is https://github.com/whatever-nevermind/Acceron-Assignment/blob/main/index.html, into https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/. This should enable you to view the Plotly graphs.
